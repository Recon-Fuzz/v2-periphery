## Documentation

### Interface Documentation

 @dev Mints exactly shares Vault shares to receiver by depositing amount of underlying tokens.
 - MUST emit the Deposit event.
 - MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the mint
   execution, and are accounted for during mint.
 - MUST revert if all of shares cannot be minted (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not
   approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).
 NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault’s underlying asset token.
